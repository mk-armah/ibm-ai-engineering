# IBM AI ENGINEERING SPECIALIZATION
This repository contains working codes of the final projects I completed in fulfillment of the individual courses available in the IBM AI Engineering Specialization.

## Machine-Learning with Python
In this first course of the IBM AI Engineering Specialization, I was asked to develop classical machine learning learning algorithms which included:
1. KNearest Neighbor Classifier
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Support Vector Classifier
4. Logistic Regression

Using Sckit-Learn Library, Scipy and Numpy.

It was required that each model is evaluated on an test data using different model evaluation techniques such as 
1. Jaccard
2. F1-score and,
3. LogLoss

The purpose of the project was to use Data Science and Machine Learning techniques to predict whether a given customer would default on a loan. As a challenge, the given dataset was highly imbalanced and hence in other to gain the best out of the models without Overfitting too much on the test set, I had to utilize complex techniques to handle the imbalanced data.

## Introduction to Computer Vision 
In this lab I was tasked train a state of the art image classifier using CV Studio. I made use of a Convolutional Neural Network as a feature generator.The ConvNet was pretrained on a very large dataset since the data provided was very little and wouldn't yield expected accuracies. Transfer Learning was applied by changing the last few layers of the model to suit the specifications of my desired model.

  Tasks..
  1. Import Libraries and Define Auxiliary Functions
  2. Create Dataset Object
  3. Load Model and Train
  4. Report model and parameters used for training back to cv-studio
  4. Deploy model as an API for public access and scoring.

## Introduction to Keras
In this project, I was tasked to build a regression model using the Keras library to model data about concrete compressive strength.
Different models were evaluated in other to better understand effect of different AI techniques such as Standardization and increasing the number of epochs for training.

Concrete Data Description:
The data is available at https://cocl.us/concrete_data. To recap, the predictors in the data of concrete strength include:
  1. Cement
  2. Blast Furnace Slag
  3. Fly Ash
  4. Water
  5. Superplasticizer
  6. Coarse Aggregate
  7. Fine Aggregate
